/*
 * CONTROL AND AUDIT. An interceptor stands between a program and the handler of one of its effects: each operation
 * comes to it first. `observe` is shown each one and passes it on; `around` is given each one and its way on, and
 * gives the answer — passed on, changed, or refused. Both are `intercept`. An effect its author declares SENSITIVE is
 * handled no other way than through an audit: `handle` and `intercept` refuse it; `audit` puts an interceptor on it
 * and leaves `Audited[S]` in the row; `handleAudited` takes only that. So every operation of a sensitive effect that
 * is answered has passed its audit, and the compiler checks it.
