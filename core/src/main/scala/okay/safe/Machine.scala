/** THE MACHINE: one loop. What waits for the value is the FRAMES of the binds, up to the nearest handler, and a
 * stack of LEVELS, one for each handler the program is under: the handler, its state, and the frames outside it.
 *
 *   Bind       a frame is pushed
 *   Done       the top frame takes the value; no frame left — the handler's `ret`, and the level is popped
 *   Handle     a new level
 *   Embedded   a new level, of no handler: it renames. In tail position under a level that renames, no new
 *              level: that one renames for both
 *   Ask        the handler of the operation's place is found. In place: it answers, the loop goes on with the
 *              answer — nothing is allocated. General: the levels above and at the handler are taken off as `k`,
 *              and the clause runs below them
 *   Resume     the levels of a `k` are put back on top
 *   Ensure     a frame is pushed that holds the finalizer. A value that comes to it waits while the finalizer
 *              runs
 *   Unwind     the levels of a `k` are put back on top, without its handler, and UNWOUND: its frames are passed
 *              with no value, a finalizer's frame runs its finalizer, a level is left without its `ret`
 *
 * HOW A HANDLER IS FOUND: by the operation's place in the row, which the compiler found (Rows.scala) — no class
 * is looked at. Walking down the levels, the place is this level's handler's, or the search goes on with the
 * operation's place in the row outside: past a handler put by `handle`, the row without its effect; past an
 * interceptor, the same row. A program put into another row (`into`) runs under a level with no handler, which
 * RENAMES: an operation that passes it has, outside, its place in that row.
 *
 * EVERYTHING IS TYPED, and nothing is cast: a level says the row inside it and the value its body comes to, the
 * frames the value they take and the one they come to, and one fits the other. The types a level hides — its
 * handler's effect, the row outside — are found again by matching on it; that an operation is its handler's is
 * shown by the two places (`same`, Rows.scala).
 *
 * Frames and the levels in a `k` are never changed: a `k` is shared, never copied, and may be resumed any number
 * of times. A level on the stack belongs to the one path that runs: a handler in place writes its state there. */
